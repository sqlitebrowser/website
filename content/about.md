This program was developed originally by Mauricio Piacentini
([@piacentini](https://github.com/piacentini)) from Tabuleiro Producoes, as
the Arca Database Browser. The original version was used as a free companion
tool to the Arca Database Xtra, a commercial product that embeds SQLite
databases with some additional extensions to handle compressed and binary data.

The original code was trimmed and adjusted to be compatible with standard
SQLite 2.x databases. The resulting program was renamed SQLite Database
Browser, and released into the Public Domain by Mauricio. Icons were
contributed by [Raquel Ravanini](http://www.raquelravanini.com), also from
Tabuleiro. Jens Miltner ([@jmiltner](https://github.com/jmiltner)) contributed
the code to support SQLite 3.x databases for the 1.2 release.

Pete Morgan ([@daffodil](https://github.com/daffodil)) created an initial
project on GitHub with the code in 2012, where several contributors fixed and
improved pieces over the years. René Peinthor ([@rp-](https://github.com/rp-))
and Martin Kleusberg ([@MKleusberg](https://github.com/MKleusberg)) then
became involved, and were the main driving force from that point.  Justin
Clift ([@justinclift](https://github.com/justinclift)) started the new [github.com/sqlitebrowser](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser) organisation on GitHub, (roughly) co-ordinates the project, and creates our Windows and macOS nightly builds.

[John T. Haller](http://johnhaller.com), of
[PortableApps.com](http://portableapps.com) fame, created the new logo.  He
based it on the Tango icon set (public domain).

In August 2014, the project was renamed to "Database Browser for SQLite" at
the request of [Richard Hipp](http://www.hwaci.com/drh) (creator of
[SQLite](http://sqlite.org)), as the previous name was creating unintended
support issues.

In September 2014, the project was renamed to "DB Browser for SQLite", to
avoid confusion with an existing application called "Database Browser".

Today, the primary maintainers of DB Browser for SQLite are
@mgrojo, @chrisjlocke, and @lucydodo,
with major contributions from @scottfurry.

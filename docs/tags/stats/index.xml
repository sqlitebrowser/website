      <title>New download and daily users stats page</title>

      <description>Today we added a new &amp;ldquo;Stats&amp;rdquo; page, showing the number of daily downloads and daily users:
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; https://sqlitebrowser.org/stats/
The graphs are generated using Redash, and should automatically update every 10 minutes:
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; https://redash.io
Being able to mouse over a particular day to get info for that day is useful, as is being able to download the data set (in various formats, but not yet SQLite 😉).
It&amp;rsquo;s running in a very low end virtual machine (eg cheap), and there&amp;rsquo;s no proper caching layer yet, so it may be a bit slow to load.</description>

      <title>Added public web stats using Fathom</title>

      <description>Added (GDPR compliant) stats generation today for the website, using Fathom. It&amp;rsquo;s an Open Source project, written in Go, that aims to provide aggregated stats simply, without any user tracking.
The setup was fairly easy, though the ARM64 download for the current release (1.2.1) doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work with SQLite due to an accidental setting during their build. Hopefully fixed for the next release.
PostgreSQL is being the database, and Nginx providing HTTPS termination.</description>

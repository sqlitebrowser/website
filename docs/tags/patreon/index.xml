      <description>Thanks to our wonderful Patrons, we&amp;rsquo;ve been able to purchase a HiDPI monitor (Dell P2415Q) for Martin, one of our senior developers.
A special thanks also goes to Nikolay Zlatev of Astra Paging too, for organising the purchase and shipping of the monitor around the EU.
This should enable (or at least strongly help) with fixing the remaining HiDPI related bugs that people have reported over the years.
Good stuff! 😀</description>

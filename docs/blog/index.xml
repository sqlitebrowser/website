      <description>On DBHub.io, we&amp;rsquo;ve just rolled out support for these extensions, for all database types:
FTS3 &amp;amp; FTS3_PARENTHESIS FTS5 GEOPOLY JSON1 MATH_FUNCTIONS RTREE SOUNDEX This means your databases are now able to use all of the functions provided by these extensions, which should be very useful for a lot of people.</description>

      <guid>/blog/live-databases-can-be-public/</guid>
      <description>Another week, and another series of exciting updates to DBHub.io
Live databases can now be public The public/private setting can now be chosen when uploading a live database, and can also be changed afterwards in the Settings page for any database.
Previously, live databases were private-only as we hadn&amp;rsquo;t wired up the permissions.
Now, they can be shared with other users. By default, sharing allows for read-only access, but you can switch this to read-write access on a user-by-user basis.</description>

      <title>Execute SQL Tab Overhaul</title>

      <guid>/blog/execute-sql-tab-overhaul/</guid>
      <description>The &amp;lsquo;Execute SQL&amp;rsquo; tab has been overhauled.
While before it was a simple textbox and a &amp;lsquo;Run SQL&amp;rsquo; button, we&amp;rsquo;ve worked hard to improve it.
&amp;ldquo;Looks like all you&amp;rsquo;ve done is removed the button&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s a bit more than that. This command window not only shows the data, but also any feedback from SQLite, eg, any errors. It has syntax-highlighting support so field names are more easily identifiable compared to keywords.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve pushed out some more great updates on DBHub.io.
Can view live database data Can generate charts from them Can write and run SQL statements on them which change the database structure (eg CREATE/DROP TABLE), as well as data manipulation SQL (eg INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) Can View Live Database Data
Each table in your database can be viewed, either showing every column, or just specific columns. You can create complex JOINs and view these quickly in tabular form.</description>

      <guid>/blog/database-sharing-has-been-improved-on-dbhub-io/</guid>
      <description>We have been hard at work making improvements to DBHub.io. We&amp;rsquo;ve not only updated database sharing, but also allowed database updates via the API. Read more about that in this blog post.
DBHub.io has allowed database sharing (databases you upload can be either private or public, with private databases shareable to specific users) since Aug 2020, but knowing what databases you&amp;rsquo;ve shared and to who has been a bit cumbersome. You&amp;rsquo;d have to remember what databases you&amp;rsquo;ve shared to then go into the settings to see who has access.</description>

      <title>Go Library (go-dbhub) updated to work with Live databases</title>

      <guid>/blog/go-library-updated-to-work-with-live-databases/</guid>
      <description>Following the news that databases can now be updated via the API, we have updated the Go library which accesses and queries your databases on DBHub.io to v0.1.0 to also use these new live features. You can easily send INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE queries without sending base64 encoded SQL queries via the API.
You can see the initial blog post for the Go library here .</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been working hard developing DBHub.io. One of the most requested features is the ability to perform INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE commands on a database. That now has an experimental implementation available via our API, and everyone is encouraged to try it out.
One excellent benefit of DBHub.io has always been performing queries on a SQLite database stored in the cloud. Together with creating snapshots and full version control, it has been a benefit to many users.</description>

      <description>We are proud to present&amp;hellip; the Apple Silicon (arm64) version of DB Browser for SQLite v3.12.2:
https://download.sqlitebrowser.org/DB.Browser.for.SQLite-arm64-3.12.2.dmg 0c2076e4479cb9db5c85123cfe9750641f92566694ff9f6c99906321a2c424e8 (SHA256 checksum) If you&amp;rsquo;re using one of Apple&amp;rsquo;s M1 or M2 based macOS devices, then this native Apple Silicon version of DB4S should work a bit better than our existing Intel based download.
Additionally, our nightly builds for macOS now have both Intel and Apple Silicon (arm64) downloads available:

      <guid>/blog/version-3-12-2-released/</guid>
      <description>This is a minor maintenance release, primarily to update the internal certificates for anonymous communication with the DBHub.io servers.
You don&amp;rsquo;t need to upgrade unless you&amp;rsquo;re using DBHub.io anonymously. If you&amp;rsquo;re using DBHub.io with your own client certificate, this upgrade won&amp;rsquo;t really do much either. 😄
The changes in this over the 3.12.1 release include:
Fix saving the list of extensions in the Preferences dialog (bd0e1feead6bb446f8a703338aa9893bf281e5b4) Corrected a typo in the French translation (3bbd4ee271f98301476143749f7bf4abed052efe) Updated the included SQLite and SQLCipher libraries to their latest release (SQLite 3.</description>

      <description>Thanks to our wonderful Patrons, we&amp;rsquo;ve been able to purchase a HiDPI monitor (Dell P2415Q) for Martin, one of our senior developers.
A special thanks also goes to Nikolay Zlatev of Astra Paging too, for organising the purchase and shipping of the monitor around the EU.
This should enable - or at least strongly help - with fixing the remaining HiDPI related bugs that people have reported over the years.</description>

      <description>This is the first bug fix release for our 3.12.x series.

      <guid>/blog/new-go-library-for-working-with-your-dbhub-io-databases/</guid>
      <description>For anyone with an interest in Go programming, there&amp;rsquo;s now a library to access and query your databases on DBHub.io:
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/go-dbhub
Documentation is in place, code quality is good, and there are worked examples for each function call.
It&amp;rsquo;s still in early stages of development, but seems to work well already. 😄
What works now Run read-only queries (eg SELECT statements) on databases, returning the results as JSON List the tables, views, and indexes present in a database List the columns in a table, view or index, along with their details (Added 2020-08-02) - Generate a diff between two databases or revisions, to transform one into the other (Added 2020-08-04) - List the branches of a database (Added 2020-08-04) - Download a complete database (Added 2020-08-05) - List the databases in your account (Added 2020-08-05) - Download the database metadata (branches, releases, tags, commits, etc) Still to do Tests for each function Upload a complete database Investigate what would be needed for this to work through the Go SQL API Anything else that people suggest and seems like a good idea 😄 Requirements Go version 1.</description>

      <description>For anyone wanting to run SQL queries against their uploaded databases, there&amp;rsquo;s now an API server: https://api.dbhub.io
As a starting point, there&amp;rsquo;s just one API call (/v1/query), and it only runs SELECT queries (eg read only database). That should be useful enough for many things though.
Query parameters Query parameters are passed via POST only, and all results are in a fairly verbose JSON format.
apikey - Your API key. These can be generated in your Settings page, when logged in to DBHub.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve begun adding the first visualisation pieces to DBHub.io, so people can display charts from their data.
eg:
This is only the starting point (eg a simple vertical bar chart) while we experiment, to find a good workflow that&amp;rsquo;s easy for people to use + customise.
We&amp;rsquo;re aiming to add several more chart types to choose from, and there being a selection of easy-to-use predefined templates as well.
Advanced users will ideally be able to input their own SQL queries for generating the data points to visualise.</description>

      <description>Our sister website, DBHub.io - where people can backup their databases, share them with others, and collaboratively develop data - has a proper landing page from today:
https://dbhub.io
It required quite a lot of effort to assemble, even though it&amp;rsquo;s just a simple description, screenshots (click them!), and an overview video. 😉
Please take a look, create an account (it&amp;rsquo;s free), and try things out.
The website code is fully Open Source, and is gaining interesting + useful capabilities over time.</description>

      <title>Standard username/password logins now working for DBHub.io</title>
      <link>/blog/standard-username-password-logins-now-working-for-dbhub-io/</link>

      <guid>/blog/standard-username-password-logins-now-working-for-dbhub-io/</guid>
      <description>A small, but important, update about DBHub.io logins. 😉
People can now create accounts using their own username/password again, instead of needing to login via GitHub, Google, or LinkedIn.
It used to work (ages ago), but Auth0 found a security problem with the version of NodeJS they were using, so disabled it for everyone last year. It was fixable by changing some stuff, which has now been done.
On a related note&amp;hellip; login (using username/password) only works if &amp;ldquo;3rd party cookies&amp;rdquo; aren&amp;rsquo;t blocked in your web browser.</description>

      <title>New download and daily users stats page</title>
      <link>/blog/new-download-daily-users-stats-page/</link>

      <guid>/blog/new-download-daily-users-stats-page/</guid>
      <description>Today we added a new &amp;ldquo;Stats&amp;rdquo; page, showing the number of daily downloads and daily users:
https://sqlitebrowser.org/stats/
The graphs are generated using Redash, and should automatically update every 10 minutes:
https://redash.io
Being able to mouse over a particular day to get info for that day is useful, as is being able to download the data set (in various formats, but not yet SQLite 😉).
It&amp;rsquo;s running in a very low end virtual machine (eg cheap), and there&amp;rsquo;s no proper caching layer yet, so it may be a bit slow to load.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the dedicated efforts of @mgrojo, our nightly builds now include a &amp;ldquo;Dark style&amp;rdquo; theme courtesy of the QDarkStyleSheet project:
To activate it, choose &amp;ldquo;Dark style&amp;rdquo; from the &amp;ldquo;Application Style&amp;rdquo; dropdown in Preferences→General:
To turn it off, choose &amp;ldquo;Follow the desktop style&amp;rdquo; instead.
The nightly builds for windows and macOS are here:

      <guid>/blog/macos-installer-rebuilt-for-3-11-1/</guid>
      <description>The macOS installer for 3.11.1 has been updated, so now when the application runs it does so in &amp;ldquo;light theme mode&amp;rdquo; (the Aqua look) on macOS Mojave. 😄
https://download.sqlitebrowser.org/DB.Browser.for.SQLite-3.11.1v2.dmg
It&amp;rsquo;s a workaround for anyone using Mojave in Dark mode, which Qt doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet properly support. Without this workaround, the colour pallete was unusable in important places. eg white on white when browsing data 😦
Jesse Jackson, thank you so much for showing us how to fix this problem.</description>

      <guid>/blog/version-3-11-1-released/</guid>
      <description>Note that this is effectively 3.11.0 from last week, with a critical bug fix on top + some other additional fixes.
Note 2 - If you&amp;rsquo;re using Dark Mode on macOS Mojave, Do Not download this release. Dark Mode support is broken (badly) on MacOS. It should (hopefully) be fixed in the next point release.
Highlights DBHub.io improvements CSV import: speed, memory usage, usability, type detection and new default rules Attach databases Menu options for filtering JSON and XML editors Improvements to the plot UI Better copy &amp;amp; paste support Dark theme support on Linux Dark mode support for windows and macOS isn&amp;rsquo;t working yet.</description>

      <title>Version 3.11.0 pulled - encrypting databases non-functional</title>

      <guid>/blog/version-3-11-0-pulled/</guid>
      <description>A serious bug has been found in the recent 3.11.0 release&amp;hellip; newly encrypting databases doesn&amp;rsquo;t work (#1732), instead displaying an error message. 😦
Existing databases - encrypted or not - can be opened without problem. The problem only occurs when attempting to newly encrypt a database.
The links on our download page have been reverted back to the prior stable release (3.10.1) for now, while we look into this.
There will probably be a 3.</description>

      <description>Added (GDPR compliant) stats generation today for the website, using Fathom. It&amp;rsquo;s an Open Source project, written in Go, that aims to provide aggregated stats simply, without any user tracking.
The setup was fairly easy, though the ARM64 download for the current release (1.2.1) doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work with SQLite due to an accidental setting during their build. Hopefully fixed for the next release.
PostgreSQL is being the database, and Nginx providing HTTPS termination.</description>

      <description>Experimenting with a new approach for the DB Browser for SQLite website, as the old 1-page website was difficult to expand with blog/info on what we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.
This new layout - using Hugo and blogdown - should be a decent foundation, and is fairly customisable.
It also has many available themes, which we&amp;rsquo;ll likely experiment with too.</description>

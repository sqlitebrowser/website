      <title>DBHub.io Shutdown</title>
      <link>/blog/dbhub-shutdown/</link>

      <description>DBHub.io will cease operating at the end of February The DBHub.io online platform hasn&amp;rsquo;t really gained any traction, so we&amp;rsquo;re shutting it down at the end of this month.
At that time all data (including user databases) will be deleted and the servers will be decommissioned.
Apologies for the short notice Ideally we&amp;rsquo;d provide several months of notice for people to arrange alternative hosting elsewhere.
However, the ongoing financial cost each month of operating the platform has to date been borne by Justin Clift personally, and his finances can no longer accommodate the expense.</description>

      <description>Our Journey with SignPath: Code Signing for Windows Binaries When distributing software, code signing is essential to ensure our users can trust the software they download, especially on an operating system like Windows that displays security warnings for unsigned software.
So for us, code signing is not just an option, but a necessity to validate software binaries, prevent tampering, and for the convenience of our users.
A Little Background on This Journey It&amp;rsquo;s not difficult to code sign and notarize software binaries for Apple macOS.</description>

      <description>Caution:
An issue has been reported where the app fails to launch on macOS Catalina (10.15.x).
We will be tracking and resolving the issue. For more information, see issue #3691.
Note that this issue is now fixed in nightly builds, and a new stable release is planned that includes this change.
We are very excited to release a new stable version after almost three years. ðŸš€
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since we&amp;rsquo;ve released a new stable version, so there are a lot of changes, see the release notes for more details.</description>

      <guid>/blog/live-databases-can-be-public/</guid>
      <description>Another week, and another series of exciting updates to DBHub.io
Live databases can now be public The public/private setting can now be chosen when uploading a live database, and can also be changed afterwards in the Settings page for any database.
Previously, live databases were private-only as we hadn&amp;rsquo;t wired up the permissions.
Now, they can be shared with other users. By default, sharing allows for read-only access, but you can switch this to read-write access on a user-by-user basis.</description>

      <description>The &amp;lsquo;Execute SQL&amp;rsquo; tab has been overhauled.
While before it was a simple textbox and a &amp;lsquo;Run SQL&amp;rsquo; button, we&amp;rsquo;ve worked hard to improve it.
&amp;ldquo;Looks like all you&amp;rsquo;ve done is removed the button&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s a bit more than that. This command window not only shows the data, but also any feedback from SQLite, eg, any errors. It has syntax-highlighting support so field names are more easily identifiable compared to keywords.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve pushed out some more great updates on DBHub.io.
Can view live database data Can generate charts from them Can write and run SQL statements on them which change the database structure (eg CREATE/DROP TABLE), as well as data manipulation SQL (eg INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) Can View Live Database Data
Each table in your database can be viewed, either showing every column, or just specific columns. You can create complex JOINs and view these quickly in tabular form.</description>

      <description>We have been hard at work making improvements to DBHub.io. We&amp;rsquo;ve not only updated database sharing, but also allowed database updates via the API. Read more about that in this blog post.
DBHub.io has allowed database sharing (databases you upload can be either private or public, with private databases shareable to specific users) since Aug 2020, but knowing what databases you&amp;rsquo;ve shared and to who has been a bit cumbersome. You&amp;rsquo;d have to remember what databases you&amp;rsquo;ve shared to then go into the settings to see who has access.</description>

      <description>Following the news that databases can now be updated via the API, we have updated the Go library which accesses and queries your databases on DBHub.io to v0.1.0 to also use these new live features. You can easily send INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE queries without sending base64 encoded SQL queries via the API.
You can see the initial blog post for the Go library here .</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been working hard developing DBHub.io. One of the most requested features is the ability to perform INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE commands on a database. That now has an experimental implementation available via our API, and everyone is encouraged to try it out.
One excellent benefit of DBHub.io has always been performing queries on a SQLite database stored in the cloud. Together with creating snapshots and full version control, it has been a benefit to many users.</description>

      <description>This is a minor maintenance release, primarily to update the internal certificates for anonymous communication with the DBHub.io servers.
You don&amp;rsquo;t need to upgrade unless you&amp;rsquo;re using DBHub.io anonymously. If you&amp;rsquo;re using DBHub.io with your own client certificate, this upgrade won&amp;rsquo;t really do much either. ðŸ˜„
The changes in this over the 3.12.1 release include:
Fix saving the list of extensions in the Preferences dialog (bd0e1feead6bb446f8a703338aa9893bf281e5b4) Corrected a typo in the French translation (3bbd4ee271f98301476143749f7bf4abed052efe) Updated the included SQLite and SQLCipher libraries to their latest release (SQLite 3.</description>

      <description>For anyone with an interest in Go programming, there&amp;rsquo;s now a library to access and query your databases on DBHub.io:
https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/go-dbhub
Documentation is in place, code quality is good, and there are worked examples for each function call.
It&amp;rsquo;s still in early stages of development, but seems to work well already. ðŸ˜„
What works now Run read-only queries (eg SELECT statements) on databases, returning the results as JSON List the tables, views, and indexes present in a database List the columns in a table, view or index, along with their details (Added 2020-08-02) - Generate a diff between two databases or revisions, to transform one into the other (Added 2020-08-04) - List the branches of a database (Added 2020-08-04) - Download a complete database (Added 2020-08-05) - List the databases in your account (Added 2020-08-05) - Download the database metadata (branches, releases, tags, commits, etc) Still to do Tests for each function Upload a complete database Investigate what would be needed for this to work through the Go SQL API Anything else that people suggest and seems like a good idea ðŸ˜„ Requirements Go version 1.</description>

      <description>For anyone wanting to run SQL queries against their uploaded databases, there&amp;rsquo;s now an API server: https://api.dbhub.io
As a starting point, there&amp;rsquo;s just one API call (/v1/query), and it only runs SELECT queries (eg read only database). That should be useful enough for many things though.
Query parameters Query parameters are passed via POST only, and all results are in a fairly verbose JSON format.
apikey - Your API key. These can be generated in your Settings page, when logged in to DBHub.</description>

      <guid>/blog/adding-basic-visualisation-capability-to-dbhub-io/</guid>
      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve begun adding the first visualisation pieces to DBHub.io, so people can display charts from their data.
eg:
This is only the starting point (eg a simple vertical bar chart) while we experiment, to find a good workflow that&amp;rsquo;s easy for people to use + customise.
We&amp;rsquo;re aiming to add several more chart types to choose from, and there being a selection of easy-to-use predefined templates as well.
Advanced users will ideally be able to input their own SQL queries for generating the data points to visualise.</description>

      <description>Our sister website, DBHub.io - where people can backup their databases, share them with others, and collaboratively develop data - has a proper landing page from today:
https://dbhub.io
It required quite a lot of effort to assemble, even though it&amp;rsquo;s just a simple description, screenshots (click them!), and an overview video. ðŸ˜‰
Please take a look, create an account (it&amp;rsquo;s free), and try things out.
The website code is fully Open Source, and is gaining interesting + useful capabilities over time.</description>

      <description>A small, but important, update about DBHub.io logins. ðŸ˜‰
People can now create accounts using their own username/password again, instead of needing to login via GitHub, Google, or LinkedIn.
It used to work (ages ago), but Auth0 found a security problem with the version of NodeJS they were using, so disabled it for everyone last year. It was fixable by changing some stuff, which has now been done.
On a related note&amp;hellip; login (using username/password) only works if &amp;ldquo;3rd party cookies&amp;rdquo; aren&amp;rsquo;t blocked in your web browser.</description>

      <guid>/blog/new-download-daily-users-stats-page/</guid>
      <description>Today we added a new &amp;ldquo;Stats&amp;rdquo; page, showing the number of daily downloads and daily users:
https://sqlitebrowser.org/stats/
The graphs are generated using Redash, and should automatically update every 10 minutes:
https://redash.io
Being able to mouse over a particular day to get info for that day is useful, as is being able to download the data set (in various formats, but not yet SQLite ðŸ˜‰).
It&amp;rsquo;s running in a very low end virtual machine (eg cheap), and there&amp;rsquo;s no proper caching layer yet, so it may be a bit slow to load.</description>

Monthly downloads These Monthly Download stats begin in August 2018, when we moved our primary download location from GitHub to our own infrastructure.
GitHub does make download stats available through their API, and it would be useful to add the historical (and ongoing) downloads from GitHub to this too.
There&amp;rsquo;s about 1/2 million downloads of our 3.</description>

To activate it, choose &amp;ldquo;Dark style&amp;rdquo; from the &amp;ldquo;Application Style&amp;rdquo; dropdown in Preferencesâ†’General:
To turn it off, choose &amp;ldquo;Follow the desktop style&amp;rdquo; instead.

      <description>The macOS installer for 3.11.1 has been updated, so now when the application runs it does so in &amp;ldquo;light theme mode&amp;rdquo; (the Aqua look) on macOS Mojave. ðŸ˜„
https://download.sqlitebrowser.org/DB.Browser.for.SQLite-3.11.1v2.dmg
It&amp;rsquo;s a workaround for anyone using Mojave in Dark mode, which Qt doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet properly support. Without this workaround, the colour pallete was unusable in important places. eg white on white when browsing data ðŸ˜¦

      <description>Note that this is effectively 3.11.0 from last week, with a critical bug fix on top + some other additional fixes.
Note 2 - If you&amp;rsquo;re using Dark Mode on macOS Mojave, Do Not download this release. Dark Mode support is broken (badly) on MacOS. It should (hopefully) be fixed in the next point release.
Highlights DBHub.io improvements CSV import: speed, memory usage, usability, type detection and new default rules Attach databases Menu options for filtering JSON and XML editors Improvements to the plot UI Better copy &amp;amp; paste support Dark theme support on Linux Dark mode support for windows and macOS isn&amp;rsquo;t working yet.</description>

      <description>A serious bug has been found in the recent 3.11.0 release&amp;hellip; newly encrypting databases doesn&amp;rsquo;t work (#1732), instead displaying an error message. ðŸ˜¦
Existing databases - encrypted or not - can be opened without problem. The problem only occurs when attempting to newly encrypt a database.
The links on our download page have been reverted back to the prior stable release (3.10.1) for now, while we look into this.
There will probably be a 3.</description>

      <description>Added (GDPR compliant) stats generation today for the website, using Fathom. It&amp;rsquo;s an Open Source project, written in Go, that aims to provide aggregated stats simply, without any user tracking.
The setup was fairly easy, though the ARM64 download for the current release (1.2.1) doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work with SQLite due to an accidental setting during their build. Hopefully fixed for the next release.
PostgreSQL is being the database, and Nginx providing HTTPS termination.</description>

      <description>Experimenting with a new approach for the DB Browser for SQLite website, as the old 1-page website was difficult to expand with blog/info on what we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.
This new layout - using Hugo and blogdown - should be a decent foundation, and is fairly customisable.
It also has many available themes, which we&amp;rsquo;ll likely experiment with too.</description>

      <description>This program was developed originally by Mauricio Piacentini (@piacentini) from Tabuleiro Producoes, as the Arca Database Browser. The original version was used as a free companion tool to the Arca Database Xtra, a commercial product that embeds SQLite databases with some additional extensions to handle compressed and binary data.
The original code was trimmed and adjusted to be compatible with standard SQLite 2.x databases. The resulting program was renamed SQLite Database Browser, and released into the Public Domain by Mauricio.</description>
